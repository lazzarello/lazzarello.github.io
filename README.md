This will require a minimum of five (5) different accounts on four services. So it's definitely some assembly required, thus the name DIY Film Festival.

1. Github account.
2. Account on ok.ru. Feels shady but it's probably fine.
3. Account on restream.io. Can do OAuth via Google. Nice.
4. restream.io's default ok.ru integration.
5. Account with minnit.chat

The good news is most of these are free. They are also easy to use.

# Recommended platforms

## Hosting

### Github Pages

Github is a platform used by software engineers to to develop code collaboratively. It also can host websites, neat! Here's how to set one up.

1. Create an account on Github.
2. Add a domain (more on this later) through Settings => Pages => Add a domain
  1. Type a domain where you can read and write records.
  2. Follow the instructions on the screen (depends on existing DNS hosting).
  3. Click Verify. The warning that it may take 24 hours was not relevant for my first attempt. It took about 5 minutes.
3. [Follow the instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) to make a new repository.
4. When you pick a theme (should I pick a theme and just say that's the correct one?) click commit for the default page to be published.

From the Github UI...edit file button.

This could be a fork-and-replace process since it's running Jekyll behind the scenes on every commit.

a normal HTML file can be added to the Jekyll site. so can a default theme. The Github quickstart is just an example renderer.

### Squarespace

This seems to be popular too. I haven't used it so can't be the best voice here.

## Video Streaming

### Audience delivery with ok.ru (free)

this site doesn't seem to have any limits on how many users can view an embedded video. Neat!
Give a custom name to a profile:
Settings => General => Profile Link
Not sure how to make a persistent URL for each stream. restream seems to make dynamic URLs for each broadcast and I have to update the HTML on the static site.

the embed links to https://ok.ru/live/3674825825876 which is how it worked when I had the link on keep notes but I think this URL changes each time  :(

### Delivery proxy with Restream.io ( 4 hours a week free )

Restream sits between OBS and the audience. For a considerably higher amount of money, it can also do audience delivery. More on that later. It makes it easy to add a single stream key to OBS in a set-it-and-forget-it way. After that it will rebroadcast (restream, get it?!) to a multitude of other popular platforms like Twitch and Facebook. We're not concerned about these basic-ass platforms, so we first head to russia, as described in the preceding chapter.

After creating an account on ok.ru from the next chapter...
Create a destination using the default ok.ru template. If you are logged in to that platform it'll ask for permission and hook up the source.
Go back to OBS and click Start Streaming in the main window.

### Video encoding with OBS (free and open)

Default restream.io stream destination. Go to Settings => Output => Video Bitrate = 5000
Add VLC Video Source under Sources, add files to the playlist.
Move to the next chapter.

## DNS

### Github Pages (free)

If you don't care about a URL ending in github.io, you can keep the default from the tutorial.

### Custom DNS with name dot com (variable pricing)

Depending on the name you which to register and if it's available, this runs about $15 a year.
Post the instructions from Github Pages for custom DNS.

DOCO https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site
Create an "apex domain" at your DNS provider if you want a URL like example.com to go to the same place as stream.example.com.
Create the CNAME record to point to the Github Pages load balancer.
Click the Enable TLS thing to do the encryption we all deserve
